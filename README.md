# Jupyter_Notebooks

This repository will contain a series of Jupyter Notebooks, primarily used to provide tutorials on using MB-System to process multibeam and lidar data. MB-System is an open source software package for the processing and display of bathymetry and backscatter imagery data derived from multibeam, interferometry, and sidescan sonars. 

The majority of these notebooks will be written in a **Bash kernel.** For instructions on how to set up the Bash kernel in Jupyter Notebooks, please refer to the Setting_up_Jupyter_Notebook_Bash.ipynb.
