# Jupyter_Notebooks
This repository will contain a series of Jupyter Notebooks, primarily used to provide tutorials on using MB-System to process multibeam and lidar data. MB-System is an open source software package for the processing and display of bathymetry and backscatter imagery data derived from multibeam, interferometry, and sidescan sonars.
